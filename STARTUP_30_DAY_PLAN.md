## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Building in Isolation:** Talk to customers EVERY day in Week 1-2. Don't assume you know their problems.

2. **Feature Bloat:** Resist urge to add "just one more feature." Ship MVP fast, iterate based on feedback.

3. **Perfectionism:** Done is better than perfect. Launch with 3-5 core features, not 20.

4. **Ignoring Metrics:** Track everything from Day 1. What gets measured gets improved.

5. **Poor Communication:** Over-communicate with co-founders. Misalignment kills startups.

6. **Neglecting Self-Care:** Startup is a marathon, not a sprint. Sleep, exercise, eat well.

7. **Analysis Paralysis:** Make decisions quickly with 70% information. Adjust as you learn.

8. **Skipping Legal Basics:** Co-founder agreement and IP assignment on Day 1. Prevents future disasters.
