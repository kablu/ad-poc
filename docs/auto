 Auto-Enrollment Flow
 
Example: I am a company employee who needs an email certificate

*Step 1: Initial Setup (Pre-configured by RA Administrator)*

RA Administrator has created an Auto-Enrollment Policy

 * Policy Name: "Employee Digital Sign Certificate"  
 * Certificate Template: Digital Sign Template 
 * Trigger: ON_LOGIN (when user logs in)
 * Eligible Groups: "All Employees" (AD Group)
 * Auto-Approve: Yes (no manual approval needed) 
 * Auto-Renew: Yes (30 days before expiry)   

The RA Administrator has pre-configured a policy that automatically issues digital signing certificates to all employees when they login.
The policy defines who gets certificates (all employees), WHEN (on login), and WHAT type (email certificates).
Auto-approval means no human intervention needed - fully automated.

* Step 2: I will Login to the RA Portal*
I will access the RA web portal 
I will enter my standard Active Directory username and password

Step 3: RA Authenticates Against Active Directory
The RA system doesn't store passwords - it validates against Active Directory (company's central user database)
AD not only confirms my identity but also returns my profile attributes like name, email, department, and group memberships and other attributes.
These attributes will be used to build certificate's Subject DN
The group memberships determine if you're eligible for auto-enrollment.

Step 4: Auto-Enrollment Trigger (Automatic Background Process)
This happens IMMEDIATELY after successful authentication, in the background. Its like a daemon/scheduler.
The RA system searches for all auto-enrollment policies where the trigger is "ON_LOGIN"
For each policy found, it checks if you're eligible by matching your AD groups against the policy's eligible groups
It then checks if you already have a valid certificate for this template i.e "Digital Sign Certificate"
If no valid certificate exists, the auto-enrollment process begins for ENROLL NEW CERTIFICATE!

Step 5: Automatic Certificate Generation (Background Process)
RA Generates new Key Pair 
The "Subject DN"  construction is from AD details of user
RA Generates CSR
Because the policy has "Auto-Approve" enabled, no human review is needed
The request bypasses the approval queue and goes directly to the CA
RA submits the CSR to the CA  
CA processes the request:
CA returns the issued certificate   
RA post or send certificate through end user response URL or user can download through RA dashboard or notification in the dashboard.
